# Projet de Fin d'Etudes

The end project so-called Projet de Fin d'Etudes (PFE) in french is a final project during the engineer cycle at ENSTA ParisTech. It had took place in a public research institute the Applied Mathematics department of ENSTA ParisTech in 2015.

The research is devoted to solving Maxwell's equations with singular electromagnetic fields in 2D and 3D using finite element method and written on FreeFem++ language. Two methods were considered, namely the mixed formulation using Lagrange multiplier and the penalization method. The convergence rate of numerical solution correspond to theoretical results in 2D and give some gueses about theoretical results in 3D.
